            <h2>How to Vote</h2>
            <p>It’s always an election year. Even when there aren’t national or statewide elections taking place, local elections are happening across the country. These elections determine local leaders and make decisions on issues that impact us close to home – from school board members to funding for law enforcement to mask mandates. Check out our state pages to find all the information you need to get out and vote in your area!</p>
