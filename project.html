          <p>Phil Murphy believes a stronger New Jersey is one that ensures and protects justice for all â€” a fairer New Jersey recognizes the powerful truth of the words Black Lives Matter. Having previously served on the national Board of Directors of the NAACP, Phil has worked with and learned from the world&#8217;s oldest civil rights organization. Although much work remains, he has placed New Jersey at the forefront of the national fight for fairness in the criminal justice system.</p>

         <p>New Jersey can and should be a place where our residents can afford to live and work for generations. As Governor, Jack Ciattarelli will lower your property taxes through comprehensive reform of our broken school funding formula &#8211; a system where 60% of state aid goes to just 5% of the districts is unsustainable.</p>

        <div class="platform-issues card-1"><a href="https://hoffmanforgovnj.com/platform/environmental-justice/">
         <h2>Environment Justice</h2>
         <p>Madelyn Hoffman supports a Real, Ecosocialist Green New Deal, similar to the one proposed by Howie Hawkins over a decade ago. While, ideally, this legislation would come from the federal government, Madelyn would support creating state level legislation to support such policies here in New Jersey until it is passed federally.</p>

          <p>Social Justice must be improved in New Jersey, as in the rest of the United States. Madelyn&#8217;s administration would actively work towards achieving social justice, a requirement for bringing about the changes we need to see in New Jersey and around the country.</p>

          <h2>Grassroots Democracy</h2>
          <p>Madelyn Hoffman supports comprehensive reforms to make New Jersey more democratic. Some highlights include ranked choice voting, ballot restructuring, lowering the voting age to 16 years of age, restoring the voting rights of the incarcerated population, expanding Civics education across all age levels, and a move to proportional representation in New Jersey&#8217;s legislature and of New Jersey&#8217;s electoral votes.</p>

         <h2>End The Lockdowns</h2>
         <p>Lockdowns don't provide any significant added safety benefit, according to science.  They especially hurt small business and the poor.  They serve to expand the wealth gap and advance crony capitalism. We have never quarantined the healthy.  Everyone should have the choice to stay home or go out.</p>

        <div class="platform-issues card-2"><a href="https://www.meleforgovernor.com/projects">
          <h2>Address Small Business, Taxes, and Leaving the State</h2>
          <p>Our current governor suggests that, if you don't like paying taxes, you are welcome to leave New Jersey.  His strategy is working for the people of our state, who can no longer afford to stay here.  The mass exodus we are experiencing in New Jersey is unprecedented, and will continue until policies change.</p>

        <div class="platform-issues card-3"><a href="https://www.meleforgovernor.com/projects">
          <h2>Promote School Choice/Home Schooling Consumer Options</h2>
          <p>Competition always incentivizes better performance, and education is no different.  School choice will foster competitive educational institutions, to the benefit of our children.  With more efficiently-organized administrations, costs can come down dramatically.  By encouraging school choice and home schooling, where tax revenue follows the student, we can lead the way in academic performance.</p>

        <div class="platform-issues card-4"><a href="https://www.meleforgovernor.com/projects">
          <h2>Reduce Medical Regulation / Enable Consumer Choice</h2>
          <p>With COVID-19 cases rising, there is more need for increased hospital and treatment capacity.  Obstacles to our private-sector health care workers need to be removed, and COVID-19 patients need access to drugs that have already been approved elsewhere.  Most disturbing, under the current governor's direction, our vulnerable seniors have been slaughtered in nursing homes receiving COVID-19 patients.</p>
